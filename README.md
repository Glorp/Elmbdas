Instrucktiens
-------------

Lambdathing that behaves mildly like [the one for Sublime](https://github.com/Glorp/SublimeLambdas), but runs in browser because Elm is language from the future.

Type things in input field. You're allowed to use `\` instead of `λ` if you wanna.

You name things with `:=`. Like,

    0 := λf.λx.x

If you're doing it right it should show up with `≝` insteada `:=`. And then you have to press enter to add it to definitions.

You remove thing from definitions by naming it to sadface and pressing enter. Like,

    0 := :(

(Can ACTUALLY leave out the :( if you wanna. Will still show up with sadface if you're doing it right.)

Also, clearly, I don't actually know Elm plox don't look at the code.
